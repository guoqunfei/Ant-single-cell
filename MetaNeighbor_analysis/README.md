## Cross-species cell-type similarity analysis with MetaNeighbor

To understand the cell-type evolution, pairwise unsupervised MetaNeighbor analyses were performed at pseudo-cell resolution.

The mean area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) score acquired from MetaNeighbor was used to quantify the similarity between cell-type pairs.
